# Configurations for determining effects of mutations on assays such as antibody
# escape, receptor affinity from soluble receptor neutralization, etc.
# Note that in the configuration for individual selections, "antibody" is used
# as a synonym for any treatment (receptor, heat, etc), and "no-antibody" is
# used as a synonym for the untreated conditions.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Define the selections
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `assays` is keyed by assay (eg, "antibody_escape", "receptor_affinity", etc). Values are:
#    - `title`: title used for selection in docs
#    - `selections`: name of key used to define all selections for this assay
#    - `averages`: name of key used to define averages across selections for this assay.
#       Leave out this key if not taking averages.
#    - `prob_escape_scale`: the scale used for the y-axis when plotting prob escape as
#      a function of concentration. Typically symlog if all values close to zero, linear
#      otherwise. Should be in the form of keyword arguments to `altair.Scale`.
#    - `scale_stat`: scale the statistic being estimated for mutation effects by this
#      number. Typically is 1 (no scaling) unless you want negative values to indicate a
#      favorable effect (as for soluble receptor selections), in which case use -1.
#    - `stat_name`: name assigned to statistic, eg, "escape" or "receptor affinity".

# Configuration for each antibody or soluble receptor selection experiment.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `<assay>_selections` is keyed by name of each selection experiment, which includes a
# no-antibody control samples and one or more antibody samples. These should typically
# be from the same library and run on same date. Selection experiments are recommended
# to be named as <Library>-<date as YYMMDD>-<description (eg, antibody)>-<replicate>.
# Each selection experiment should in turn provide the following keys:
#  - `neut_standard_name`: name of neutralization standard in `neut_standard_barcodes`
#  - `no_antibody_sample`: name of the no-antibody sample
#  - `antibody_samples`: a dict keyed by sample name with values of:
#    * `concentration`: the concentration of the antibody
#    * `use_in_fit`: whether to use this sample in the `polyclonal` fit
#  - `prob_escape_filters`: dict giving filters of prob_escape values to use for fitting
#  - `polyclonal_params`: dict giving parameters for `polyclonal` model fitting.
#  - `escape_plot_kwargs`: dict giving parameters for `polyclonal` escape plot
#  - `plot_hide_stats`: dict giving data frames with stats for slider to hide mutations
# The `use_in_fit` option exists because you may decide that some samples are outside
# the preferred neutralization range to include in the fit, so if `use_in_fit: false`
# then functional scores are computed and plotted but it is not included in the fit.

    Use the site zoom bar at the top to zoom in on specific sites. The line plot shows a summary statistic indicating of the mutation effects at each site. The heat map shows effects for individual mutations, with parental amino-acid identities indicated by x and gray indicating non-measured mutations. Mouse over points for details.

    Options at the bottom of the plot let you modify the display, such as by selecting how many different variants a mutation must be seen in to be shown (*minimum times_seen*), how many different experimental selections the mutation was measured in (*minimum n_models*), what site summary statistic to show, etc.

    You can filter by the functional effects of mutations. Mutations removed by this filter are shown as dark gray squares in the heat map to distinguish unmeasured mutations from ones measured to be deleterious.

    The *minimum max* slider is useful to select the sites where mutations have the largest effect.
