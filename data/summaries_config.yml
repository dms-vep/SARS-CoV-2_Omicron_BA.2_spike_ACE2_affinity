# Configuration for creating summary plots across assays.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Define how to create an integrated set of line plots and heat maps that summarizes
# antibody escape alongside other assays (eg, functional effects of mutations).

summary:
  min_times_seen: 3  # only include mutations with times_seen >= this
  min_frac_models: 1  # only include mutations in >= this fraction of models
  alphabet: [A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, Y, -]  # amino acids to include
  init_floor_escape_at_zero: true  # initially floor site escape to be >= 0?
  init_site_escape_stat: sum  # initially show site escape as this statistic
  antibody_escape: {}
  func_effects:  # effects of mutations on function
    spike mediated entry:  # name of functional selection

    This is is an interactive chart. Mouseover points for details and measurements, and
    use the top zoom bar to zoom in on specific sites. The heatmaps show the effects
    of mutations on functions of the protein, and the sliders let you filter for
    mutations with some minimal functional effect.
